# Sleep and lifestyle analysis


### Project Overview

Exploring the Interplay between Heart Rate, Stress Levels, and Lifestyle Factors to Identify the Varied Patterns Affecting Sleep Quality Meaningful insights that lead to better health and wellness decisions.

### Data sources

sleep and lifestyle data; The primary data was obtained from Kaggle site [link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

### Tools 

- Excel - Data cleaning 
- Tableau  - Analysis and Data visualization
  
### Data cleaning/preparation

The initial data preparation is as follows;

1. Data Loading and Inspections
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory data analysis

The  explorative data analysis involved exploring the sleep and lifestyle dataset to answer key questions such as;

1. Are there notable differences in sleep patterns based on occupation?
2. How does heart rate impact sleep quality and duration?
3. Does stress level significantly influence sleep quality?
4. How does physical activity correlate with sleep health?

 ### Result Analysis
 
 The result of the analysis is as follows:
 
 1. I found that sleep patterns vary greatly among occupations such as Doctors, Nurses, and software engineers compared to occupations such as sales managers, managers, scientists, and teachers. 
  
2.  Discovered that heart rate has a significant impact on sleep quality and also in duration. The more the heart rate the less the sleep quality. and this is because during sleep heart rate becomes slower thereby increasing sleep quality. Cases where heart rates are high can lead to anxiety and stress leading to poor sleep quality.
   
3. Stress level was discovered to have a contributing effect on sleep quality.
    
4. Physical activity was discovered not to affect sleep health at all.


### Recommendation
1. The high variation in sleep patterns among nurses and doctors, most especially, means that their sleep schedules are quite irregular. This could be due to shift work, long hours, or varying work schedules.
   
2. Higher heart rates are linked to poorer sleep quality, as a slower heart rate during sleep promotes deeper rest. Elevated heart rates can contribute to anxiety and stress, further disrupting sleep. Employees should regularly monitor their heart rates to support better sleep and overall well-being.
   
4. High stress levels make it harder to fall asleep, cause frequent awakenings, and disrupt deep sleep due to elevated cortisol levels. To support well-being and productivity, employers should promote flexible schedules, encourage regular breaks, foster open communication, and implement stress management programs.
