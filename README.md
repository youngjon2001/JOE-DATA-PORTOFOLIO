# Sleep and lifestyle analysis


### Project Overview

Exploring the Interplay between Heart Rate, Stress Levels, and Lifestyle Factors to Identify the Varied Patterns Affecting Sleep Quality Meaningful insights that lead to better health and wellness decisions.

### Data sources

sleep and lifestyle data; The primary data was obtained from Kaggle site [link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

### Tools 

- Excel - Data cleaning 
- Tableau  - Analysis and Data visualization
  
### Data cleaning/preparation

The initial data preparation is as follows;

1. Data Loading and Inspections
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory data analysis

The  explorative data analysis involved exploring the sleep and lifestyle dataset to answer key questions such as;

1. Are there notable differences in sleep patterns based on occupation?
2. How does heart rate impact sleep quality and duration?
3. Does stress level significantly influence sleep quality?
4. How does physical activity correlate with sleep health?


 ### Data Analysis

 


 ### Result Analysis
 
 The result of the analysis is as follows:
 
 1. I found that sleep patterns vary greatly among occupations such as Doctors, Nurses, and software engineers compared to occupations such as sales managers, managers, scientists, and teachers. The high variation in sleep patterns among nurses and doctors, most especially, means that their sleep schedules are quite irregular. This could be due to shift work, long hours, or varying work schedules.
  
2.  Discovered that heart rate has a significant impact on sleep quality and also in duration. The more the heart rate the less the sleep quality. and this is because during sleep heart rate becomes slower thereby increasing sleep quality. Cases where heart rates are high can lead to anxiety and stress leading to poor sleep quality.
   
3. Stress level was discovered to have a contributing effect on sleep quality.
    
4. Physical activity was discovered not to affect sleep health at all.
